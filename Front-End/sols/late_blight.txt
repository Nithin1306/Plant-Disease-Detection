Late blight is controlled by eliminating cull piles and 
volunteer potatoes, using proper harvesting and storage 
practices, and applying fungicides when necessary. 
Air drainage to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is 
important. Under marginal conditions, overhead sprinkler 
irrigation can favor late blight; in Tule Lake under solid set 
sprinklers, conditions conducive to late blight development 
are enhanced by day time irrigation but not night time 
irrigation.
