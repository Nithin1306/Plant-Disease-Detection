Early blight can be minimized by maintaining optimum 
growing conditions, including proper fertilization, irrigation,
 and management of other pests. Grow later maturing, 
longer season varieties. Fungicide application is justified 
only when the disease is initiated early enough to cause 
economic loss.
When justified, apply fungicides as soon as symptoms 
appear; continued protection requires application at 
7- to 10-day intervals.
